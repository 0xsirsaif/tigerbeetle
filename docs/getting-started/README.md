# Getting Started

## 1. Download

You can find more options to [download TigerBeetle here](./download.md), but you can use the
bootstrap script to get started quickly:

### macOS/Linux

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle && cd tigerbeetle && ./bootstrap.sh
```

### Windows

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle && cd tigerbeetle && .\bootstrap.ps1
```

## 2. Create and Run a Cluster

Try running a single or multi-node cluster using the prebuilt binary:

- [Single-node cluster](./single-binary.md)
- [Three-node cluster](./single-binary-three.md)

Or, you can run TigerBeetle with Docker:

- [Single-node cluster with Docker](./with-docker.md)
- [Three-node cluster with Docker Compose](./with-docker-compose.md)

## 3. Create Accounts and Transfers with the CLI

When you have a cluster running, try creating some accounts and transfers [using the TigerBeetle
CLI](./cli-repl.md).
