# TigerBeetle Docs

TigerBeetle is a distributed financial accounting database designed for mission critical safety and
performance.

## Quick Start

[Download TigerBeetle](./quick-start/README.md) and run a
[single-node](./quick-start/single-node.md) or [multi-node cluster](./quick-start/cluster.md) in
under 2 minutes.

Then, [create accounts and transfers using the REPL](./getting-started/cli-repl.md) to get a feel
for what TigerBeetle can do.

## Developing on TigerBeetle

Read more about [Developing on TigerBeetle](./develop/README.md) to understand the
data model, learn how to integrate TigerBeetle into your system, and see some advanced design
patterns.
