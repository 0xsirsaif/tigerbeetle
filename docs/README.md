# TigerBeetle Docs

TigerBeetle is a distributed financial accounting database designed
for mission critical safety and performance.

## Getting Started

Head over to [Getting Started](./getting-started/README.md) to
[download](./getting-started/download.md) TigerBeetle, [run a
cluster](./getting-started/single-binary.md), and try [creating accounts and transfers using the
CLI](./getting-started/cli-repl.md).

## Developing on TigerBeetle

Read more about [Developing on TigerBeetle](./develop/README.md) to understand the
data model, learn how to integrate TigerBeetle into your system, and see some advanced design
patterns.

## Client libraries

TigerBeetle cluster:

- [.NET](/src/clients/dotnet/README.md)
- [Go](/src/clients/go/README.md)

- [Node.js](/src/clients/node/README.md)

Within each client library README you will find links to sample code.
