can participant position ever be negative?
how does mojaloop handle duplicate errors?
who uses mojaloop's bulk functionality?
would be cool to get ml-api-adaptor logs from a real deployment so we can gauge usage of apis and what we need to optimize
config for idempotency failure mode (silent or fail)
config for max batch size
batches should have a type for the whole batch:
  create participants if not exist
  update participants if exist
  create transfers
  accept transfers
  reject transfers

do we need to store transfers in-memory that we can't process because of a validation error?
